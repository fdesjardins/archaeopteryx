# Archaeopteryx

> Archaeopteryx (/ˌɑrkiːˈɒptərɨks/ ar-kee-op-tər-iks), sometimes referred to by its German name Urvogel ("original bird" or "first bird"), is a genus of early bird that is transitional between feathered dinosaurs and modern birds. The name derives from the ancient Greek ἀρχαῖος (archaīos) meaning "ancient", and πτέρυξ (ptéryx), meaning "feather" or "wing".

Archaeopteryx is a fast, flexible drone toolkit used for implementing robotic control systems. Initially conceived for flying drones, archaeopteryx can be used for a variety of autonomous and semi-autonomous agents.
